            <h3>Obsidian Policy on Privacy of Customer Personal Information</h3>

            <p>Dynalist is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information obtained by
                reason of your use of OBSIDIAN. This policy explains the types of customer personal information we
                collect, how it is used, and the steps we take to ensure your personal information is handled
                appropriately.</p>

            <p>Our policies and practices have been designed to comply with the <em>Personal Information Protection and
                    Electronic Documents Act</em> (Canada) and corresponding provincial privacy acts.</p>

            <h3>Who is Dynalist?</h3>

            <p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “<b>Dynalist</b>” means Dynalist Inc., the company developing and
                providing OBSIDIAN and related websites and services. </p>

            <h3>What is personal information?</h3>

            <p>Personal information is information that refers to an individual specifically and is recorded in any
                form. Personal information includes such things as age, income, date of birth, ethnic origin and credit
                records. Information about individuals contained in the following documents is not considered personal
                information:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>public telephone directories, where the subscriber can refuse to be listed</li>
                <li>professional and business directories available to the public</li>
                <li>public registries and court records</li>
                <li>other publicly available printed and electronic publications</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>We are accountable to you</h3>

            <p>Dynalist is responsible for all personal information under its control. Our team is accountable for
                compliance with these privacy and security principles.</p>

            <h3>We let you know why we collect and use your personal information and get your consent</h3>

            <p>Dynalist identifies the purpose for which your personal information is collected and will be used or
                disclosed. If that purpose is not listed below we will do this before or at the time the information is
                actually being collected. You will be deemed to consent to our use of your personal information for the
                purpose of:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>communicating with you generally</li>
                <li>processing your purchases</li>
                <li>processing and keeping track of transactions and reporting back to you</li>
                <li>protecting against fraud or error</li>
                <li>providing product and services requested by you</li>
                <li>recommending products and services that Dynalist believes will be of interest and provide value to
                    you
                </li>
                <li>performing statistical analyses of user behaviour and characteristics, in order to measure interest
                    in and use of the various sections of this site so as to improve design and navigation and to gather
                    marketing information. Only aggregated data from these analyses, not individual data, will be used
                    for this purpose
                </li>
                <li>complying with legal and governmental requirements</li>
                <li>fulfilling any other purpose that would be reasonably apparent to the average person at the time we
                    collect it from you
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Otherwise, Dynalist will obtain your express consent (by verbal, written or electronic agreement) to
                collect, use or disclose your personal information. You can change your consent preferences at any time
                by contacting Dynalist (please refer to the “How to contact us” section below). </p>

            <h3>We limit collection of your personal information</h3>

            <p>Dynalist collects only the information required to provide products and services to you. Dynalist will
                collect personal information only by clear, fair and lawful means.</p>

            <p>We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose
                not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our
                features.</p>

            <p>Dynalist does not receive or store personal content saved to your local device while using Obsidian.</p>

            <p>We also receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like
                many websites, we use “cookies,” and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser
                accesses Obsidian.md.</p>

            <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web
                browser, to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as keeping you
                logged in to your Obsidian account.</p>

            <p>The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
                accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
                disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser
                add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the website of its
                manufacturer. </p>

            <p>Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to
                connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection
                information, such as browser type, version and timezone setting, browser plug-in types and versions,
                operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and
                from our website, including date and time; cookie numbers; products you viewed or searched for; and the
                telephone number used to call our customer service number. We may also use browser data such as cookies,
                Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our
                website for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as
                JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors,
                length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and
                mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.</p>

            <h3>We limit disclosure and retention of your personal information</h3>

            <p>Dynalist does not disclose personal information to any organization or person for any reason except the
                following:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
                    fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive
                    information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit
                    card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to
                    perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. We may use service providers located
                    outside of Canada, and, if applicable, your personal information may be processed and stored in
                    other countries and therefore may be subject to disclosure under the laws of those countries.
                </li>

                <li>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business
                    units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business
                    assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of
                    course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Dynalist or substantially
                    all of its assets are acquired, customer information of course will be one of the transferred
                    assets.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>You are deemed to consent to disclosure of your personal information for those purposes. If your personal
                information is shared with third parties, those third parties are bound by appropriate agreements with
                Dynalist to secure and protect the confidentiality of your personal information.</p>

            <p>Dynalist retains your personal information only as long as it is required for our business relationship
                or as required by federal and provincial laws.</p>

            <h3>We keep your personal information up to date and accurate</h3>

            <p>Dynalist keeps your personal information up to date, accurate and relevant for its intended use.</p>

            <p>You may request access to the personal information we have on record in order to review and amend the
                information, as appropriate. In circumstances where your personal information has been provided by a
                third party, we will refer you to that party (e.g. credit bureaus). To access your personal information,
                refer to the “How to contact us” section below.</p>

            <h3>The security of your personal information is a priority for Dynalist</h3>

            <p>We take steps to safeguard your personal information, regardless of the format in which it is held,
                including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>physical security measures such as restricted access facilities and locked filing cabinets</li>
                <li>electronic security measures for computerized personal information such as password protection,
                    database encryption and personal identification numbers. We work to protect the security of your
                    information during transmission by using “Transport Layer Security” (TLS) protocol.
                </li>
                <li>organizational processes such as limiting access to your personal information to a selected group of
                    individuals
                </li>
                <li>contractual obligations with third parties who need access to your personal information requiring
                    them to protect and secure your personal information
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>It’s important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and your computer. Be sure
                to sign off when you’ve finished using any shared computer.</p>

            <h3>What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?</h3>

            <p>Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any
                personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites.</p>

            <p>These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf,
                sometimes use technology to send (or “serve”) the advertisements that appear on our website directly to
                your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies,
                JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to
                measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to
                or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these
                advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them
                directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising
                Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called “ad networks” or
                “network advertisers”), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection. You
