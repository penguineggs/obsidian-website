                time
                to time (each an “Access Agreement” and collectively, the “<b>Access Agreements</b>”).</p>

            <h3>ACCEPTANCE</h3>

            <p>By using or accessing the Services or OBSIDIAN, you accept and agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of
                Service, (ii) all Access Agreements to which you are party, which are hereby incorporated herein by
                reference, and (iii) our Privacy Policy, found at <a href="https://obsidian.md/privacy">https://obsidian.md/privacy</a>
                (the “<b>Privacy Policy</b>”) which is incorporated herein by reference (collectively referred to as the
                “<b>Agreement</b>”). </p>

            <p>This Agreement constitutes a binding agreement between the Customer (“<b>Customer</b>,” “<b>you</b>,” and
                “<b>your</b>”) and the Company. This Agreement represents the parties’ entire understanding regarding
                the Services and
                shall govern over any prior oral or written agreement or discussions or different or additional terms or
                conditions of any purchase order, invoice or other non-Company ordering document. No other terms or
                conditions of any purchase order, invoice or other non-Company ordering document shall apply to the
                Services.</p>

                grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, worldwide right to access and use the purchased Services
                in accordance with the terms set out in this Agreement (the “<b>License</b>”).</p>

            <p>The License is granted on a per-user basis and is valid for use on all supported operating systems. A
                License may be used on multiple computers and operating systems, provided that only the proper
                registered user of such License accesses or makes use of the applicable Services.</p>

            <p>Licenses are non-transferrable and may not be distributed, sold, rented, leased or otherwise assigned or
                transferred to any third party(ies).</p>

            <p>A. <em>Personal Use</em>. A License permits use of OBSIDIAN for free for your own, private,
                non-commercial
                purposes (e.g. taking notes, doing research) (“<b>Personal Use</b>”). For the avoidance of doubt, the
                use of
                OBSIDIAN for the exercise of your own trade or profession for which you are compensated compensation
                (e.g. teamwork with colleagues, writing work reports, etc.) does not qualify as Personal Use.</p>

            <p>B. <em>De Minimis Commercial Use</em>. A License permits use of OBSIDIAN for free for non-Personal Use by
                individuals, sole proprietorships, or other one-person organizations.</p>

            <p>C. <em>Not For Profit Use</em>. A License permits use of OBSIDIAN for free by registered charitable and
                not-for-profit organizations; provided, that such use is not in connection with non-Personal Use by any
                other Person.</p>

            <p>D. <em>Commercial Use</em>. In all other circumstances, a License permits the use of OBSIDIAN only after
                payment
                of all associated fees with respect to each individual/user of OBSIDIAN; provided, that the fees
                associated with a License are not required for a period of no more than fourteen (14) days for testing
                and evaluation purposes only.</p>

            <h3>CATALYST</h3>

            <p>CATALYST is a special purpose license granting early access to exclusive OBSIDIAN versions. CATALYST is
                not required for personal use of OBSIDIAN.</p>

            <h3>NOT PROFESSIONAL ADVICE</h3>

            <p>OBSIDIAN and our other Services assist you to take notes and build a digital knowledge base. However, any
                materials available through OBSIDIAN and/or other Services and any information, training and/or advice
                provided, (collectively, the "Service Materials") are for informational purposes only; they are not
                guaranteed to be correct, complete or up-to-date, and use and work product resulting from the use of
                OBSIDIAN and our other Services will be yours. You understand that our providing of OBSIDIAN and any
                other Services to you does not constitute any guarantee of a particular outcome or otherwise make us
                responsible in any way for the success or failure of any project you undertake in connection with the
                use of OBSIDIAN and any other Services.</p>

            <h3>USE OF SERVICES</h3>

            <p>You may use the Services only if you have reached the age of majority where you live, and you can form
                legally binding contracts under applicable law. You may not use the Services if you live in a
                jurisdiction where access to or use of the Services or any part of them may be illegal or prohibited. It
                is solely your responsibility to determine whether your use of the website is lawful, and you must
                comply with all applicable laws. </p>

            <p>You are prohibited from contributing, posting or transmitting to the Services any infringing, unlawful,
                threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, indecent, inflammatory, pornographic or profane content or
                any content that could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offence, give
                rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any law. Any content you contribute, post or transmit to
                the Services may not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial
                solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of “spam.” You may not use a false e-mail
                address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of a card or other
                content. The Company reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content, but
                does not regularly review posted content.</p>

            <p>In its sole discretion, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to the Company and without
                any liability whatsoever, at any time and without notice may terminate or restrict your access to any
                component of obsidian.md.</p>

            <h3>FEES</h3>

            <p>You agree to pay all fees set out in an Access Agreement. All fees are non-cancellable and non-refundable
                and are based on Services purchased and not actual usage. Unless otherwise agreed between you and us,
                charges may be paid by credit card, electronic funds transfer or bank/wire transfer. For the avoidance
                of doubt, you shall not be entitled to any refund in the event of unused Services.</p>

            <h3>PAYMENT TERMS</h3>

            <p>Unless otherwise set out in the Access Agreement, Service fees are payable at the time of entrance into
                an Access Agreement. All fees are exclusive of taxes, levies or duties imposed by taxing authorities,
                and Customer shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies or duties (excluding taxes based
                on the Company’s income), even if such amounts are not listed on an Access Agreement. Customer shall pay
                all fees in Canadian Dollars or in such other currency as agreed to in writing by the parties without
                set-off or deduction.</p>

                days after we have provided you with notice of such failure. Any suspension of the Services by us under
                this section shall not relieve you of your payment obligations under this Agreement. We will not be
                liable to you nor to any third party for any suspension of the Services resulting from your non-payment
                of fees.</p>
